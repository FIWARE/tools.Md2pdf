# Structured values for attributes

Apart from simple strings such as "22.5" or "yellow", you can use
complex structures as attribute values. In particular, an attribute can
be set to a vector or to a key-value map (usually referred to as an
"object") using [updateContext](walkthrough_apiv1.md#update-context-elements) (or
equivalent [convenience operation](walkthrough_apiv1.md#Convenience_Update_Context)). These values are
retrieved with a [queryContext](walkthrough_apiv1.md#query-context-operation) on
that attribute (or equivalent [convenience operation](walkthrough_apiv1.md#Convenience_Query_Context)) and notifyContext
notifications sent as a consequence of a NGSI10 subscriptions.

Vector or key-map values correspond directly to JSON vectors and JSON
objects, respectively. Thus, the following updateContext request sets
the value of attribute "A" to a vector and the value of attribute B to a
key-map object (we use UPDATE as actionType, but this can be used at
initial entity or attribute creation with APPEND).

      (curl localhost:1026/v1/updateContext -s -S --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d @- | python -mjson.tool) <<EOF
      {
	  "contextElements": [
	      {
		  "type": "T1",
		  "isPattern": "false",
		  "id": "E1",
		  "attributes": [
		      {
			  "name": "A",
			  "type": "T",
			  "value": [
			      "22",
			      {
				  "x": [
				      "x1",
				      "x2"
				  ],
				  "y": "3"
			      },
			      [
				  "z1",
				  "z2"
			      ]
			  ]
		      },
		      {
			  "name": "B",
			  "type": "T",
			  "value": {
			      "x": {
				  "x1": "a",
				  "x2": "b"
			      },
			      "y": [
				  "y1",
				  "y2"
			      ]
			  }
		      }
		  ]
	      }
	  ],
	  "updateAction": "UPDATE"
      }
      EOF


The value of the attribute is stored internally by Orion Context Broker
in a format-independent representation. 

Note that (for API version 1) in order to align JSON representations, the final "leaf"
elements of the structured attribute values after traversing all vectors
and key-maps are always considered as strings. Thus, take into account that
although you can use for instance a JSON number as a field value in updates
(such as `{"x": 3.2 }`), you will retrieve a string in queries and notifications 
(i.e. `{ "x": "3.2"}`).

In API version 2, the final "leaf" elements of the structured attribute values after traversing all vectors and key-maps uses the right native JSON type (number, boolean, etc.). Thus, take if you use for instance a JSON number as a field value in updates (such as `{"x": 3.2 }`), you will retrieve also a number in queries and notifications (i.e. `{ "x": 3.2}`).
