# Mixing standard and convenience operations

You can mix standard and convenience operations 
without any problem. Note that the set of URLs used by standard
operations
([NGSI10](walkthrough_apiv1.md#summary-of-ngsi10-standard-operations-urls) and
[NGSI9](walkthrough_apiv1.md#summary-of-ngsi9-standard-operations-urls)) and the
set of URLs used by convenience operations
([NGSI10](walkthrough_apiv1.md#summary-of-ngsi10-standard-operations-url) and
[NGSI9](walkthrough_apiv1.md#summary-of-ngsi9-standard-operations-urls)) are
orthogonal.

However, take into account some convenience operations don't allow to
specify any type for entities nor for attributes, so the rules described
in [using empty types section](empty_types.md#using-empty-types) apply.
