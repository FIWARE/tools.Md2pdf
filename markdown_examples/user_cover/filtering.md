# Introduction

Orion Context Broker implements several filters
that can be used to filter the results in NGSI10 query operations. These
filters are typically used with [queryContext with patterns](walkthrough_apiv1.md#query-context-operation) or [the convenience operation to get all entities](walkthrough_apiv1.md#getting-all-entities).

As a general rule, filters used in standard operation use a scope
element:

 
      (curl localhost:1026/v1/queryContext -s -S --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d @- | python -mjson.tool) <<EOF
      {
	  "entities": [
	      {
		  "type": "myEntityType",
		  "isPattern": "true",
		  "id": ".*"
	      }
	  ],
	  "restriction": {
	      "scopes": [
		  {
		      "type": "FIWARE::Filter::foobar",
		      "value": ""
		  }
	      ]
	  }
      }
      EOF                                                                                                                 

while filters in convenience operations are included as parameters in
the URL:

    curl localhost:1026/v1/contextEntities?filter=value -s -S --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' | python -mjson.tool

Filters are cumulative. In other words, you can use several scopes in
the same restriction (in the case of standard operations) or several URL
argument separated by '&' in order to specify several filters. The
result is a logic "and" between all of them.

## Existence type filter

The scope correspoding to this type is "FIWARE::Filter::Existence". 

      ...                                                           
      {
	  "restriction": {
	      "scopes": [
		  {
		      "type": "FIWARE::Filter::Existence",
		      "value": "entity::type"
		  }
	      ]
	  }
      }
      ...                                                           
  
The URL parameter corresponding to this filter is 'exist'.

    curl localhost:1026/v1/contextEntities?exist=entity::type ...

In the current version, the only parameter than can be checked for
existence is the entity type, corresponding to "entity::type".

## No-Existence type filter

The scope corresponding to this type is "FIWARE::Filter::Not::Existence".

      ...                                                                
      {
	  "restriction": {
	      "scopes": [
		  {
		      "type": "FIWARE::Filter::Not::Existence",
		      "value": "entity::type"
		  }
	      ]
	  }
      }
      ...                                                                
  
The URL parameter corresponding to this filter is '!exist'.

    curl localhost:1026/v1/contextEntities?!exist=entity::type ...

In the current version, the only parameter than can be checked for
no-existence is the entity type, corresponding to "entity::type". Note
that this is the only way of selecting an "entity without type" (given
that queries without type resolve to "any type", as explained in the
[following section](empty_types.md#using-empty-types)).

## Entity type filter

There is no scope corresponding to this filter, given that you can use
the usual entity type:


      ...                                            
      {
	  "type": "Room",
	  "isPattern": "...",
	  "id": "..."
      }
      ...


The URL parameter corresponding to this filter is 'entity::type'.

    curl localhost:1026/v1/contextEntities?entity::type=Room ...

## Geo-location filter

The scope corresponding to this type is "FIWARE::Location". It is
described in detail in [the following section](geolocation.md#geo-located-queries).

In the current version of Orion, there is no equivalent convenience
operation filter.

## String filter

The scope corresponding to this type is "FIWARE::StringFilter".

      ...
      {
          "restriction": {
              "scopes": [
                  {
                      "type": "FIWARE::StringFilter",
                      "value": "temperature<24;humidity==75..90;status=running"
                  }
              ]
          }
      }
      ...

This scope allows to express filtering conditions such as equality, unequality,
greater/less than, range or existence.

There isn't any URL parameter correspondence for this filter in NGSI v1. In NGSI v2
it corresponds to the `q` parameter:

    curl 'localhost:1026/v2/entities?q=temperature<24;humidity==75..90;status=running'

For a detailed syntax description of the `value` or `q` parameter, see [NGSIv2 specification document](http://telefonicaid.github.io/fiware-orion/api/v2/).

You can use this scope in NGSI v1, but take into account that in order to set attribute
values to numbers, you need to use NGSI v2 (NGSI v1 always uses strings for values).
